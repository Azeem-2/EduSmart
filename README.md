### Prompt: I want to store metadata in a markdown file from YAML or TOML which format should i choose to embed metadata in markdown file


For embedding metadata in Markdown files, **YAML** is the more widely adopted and recommended format. This practice is commonly known as "YAML front matter," where metadata is enclosed between `---` delimiters at the top of the Markdown file. Here's why YAML is generally the preferred choice:

1. **Widespread Support**: Many static site generators and Markdown processors—such as Jekyll, Pandoc, and Gatsby—natively support YAML front matter. This makes it easier to integrate your Markdown files with various tools and platforms.

2. **Readability**: YAML's syntax is designed to be human-readable and easy to write. Its structure is intuitive, especially for hierarchical data, which is beneficial when defining complex metadata.

3. **Community Standards**: Using YAML aligns with common practices in the Markdown community. This can make collaboration with others smoother, as they are likely familiar with YAML front matter.

**Example of YAML Front Matter:**

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
date: "2021-01-01"
tags:
  - markdown
  - yaml
---
```

**When to Consider TOML:**

TOML is also a human-readable configuration file format and is used by some tools like Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. TOML front matter is enclosed between `+++` delimiters. If you're using a tool that specifically recommends or requires TOML, then it would be appropriate to use it.

**Example of TOML Front Matter:**

```toml
+++
title = "My Document"
date = "2021-01-01"
tags = ["markdown", "toml"]
+++
```

**Conclusion:**

Unless you have a specific requirement or preference for TOML, **YAML is the recommended format for embedding metadata in Markdown files** due to its widespread adoption and support across various tools and platforms.



## Prompt: How do u parse yaml front matter from a markdown file?

To parse YAML front matter from a Markdown file, you'll need to:

1. **Read the Markdown file as text.**
2. **Extract the YAML front matter.**
3. **Parse the extracted YAML content using a YAML parser.**

Below are step-by-step instructions and code examples in **Python** and **JavaScript**.

---

### **Understanding YAML Front Matter**

YAML front matter is typically placed at the very beginning of a Markdown file, enclosed between two lines containing `---`. It looks like this:

```markdown
---
title: "My Document"
date: "2021-01-01"
tags:
  - markdown
  - yaml
---

# Heading

Your markdown content goes here.
```

---

### **Parsing in Python**

**Requirements:**

- Install the `PyYAML` library to parse YAML:

  ```bash
  pip install PyYAML
  ```

**Code Example:**

```python
import yaml
import re

def parse_yaml_front_matter(markdown_text):
    # Regular expression to match YAML front matter
    pattern = r'^---\s*\n(.*?)\n---\s*\n(.*)$'
    match = re.match(pattern, markdown_text, re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        yaml_content = match.group(1)
        markdown_body = match.group(2)
        # Parse the YAML content
        metadata = yaml.safe_load(yaml_content)
        return metadata, markdown_body
    else:
        return {}, markdown_text

# Read the markdown file
with open('example.md', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    markdown_text = file.read()

metadata, markdown_body = parse_yaml_front_matter(markdown_text)

print("Metadata:", metadata)
print("Markdown Body:", markdown_body)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Regex Pattern:** The regular expression `^---\s*\n(.*?)\n---\s*\n(.*)$` matches:

  - The start `---` delimiter.
  - Captures everything until the ending `---`.
  - Extracts the rest of the document.

- **Parsing YAML:** `yaml.safe_load(yaml_content)` converts the YAML string into a Python dictionary.

---

### **Parsing in JavaScript**

**Requirements:**

- Install `js-yaml` to parse YAML:

  ```bash
  npm install js-yaml
  ```

**Code Example (Node.js):**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const yaml = require('js-yaml');

function parseYamlFrontMatter(markdownText) {
    // Regular expression to match YAML front matter
    const pattern = /^---\s*\n([\s\S]*?)\n---\s*\n([\s\S]*)$/;
    const match = markdownText.match(pattern);
    if (match) {
        const yamlContent = match[1];
        const markdownBody = match[2];
        // Parse the YAML content
        const metadata = yaml.load(yamlContent);
        return { metadata, markdownBody };
    } else {
        return { metadata: {}, markdownBody: markdownText };
    }
}

// Read the markdown file
const markdownText = fs.readFileSync('example.md', 'utf8');

const { metadata, markdownBody } = parseYamlFrontMatter(markdownText);

console.log('Metadata:', metadata);
console.log('Markdown Body:', markdownBody);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Regex Pattern:** The pattern `^---\s*\n([\s\S]*?)\n---\s*\n([\s\S]*)$` matches the YAML front matter and the markdown content.
- **Parsing YAML:** `yaml.load(yamlContent)` converts the YAML string into a JavaScript object.

---

### **General Steps**

1. **Identify the Front Matter Block:**

   - The YAML front matter is between the first pair of `---` lines at the top.
   - Use regular expressions or string operations to locate this block.

2. **Extract YAML Content:**

   - Once identified, extract the text between the `---` delimiters.

3. **Parse YAML:**

   - Use a YAML parser to convert the extracted YAML string into a data structure.

4. **Access Markdown Content:**

   - The rest of the file after the front matter is your Markdown content.

---

### **Using Existing Libraries**

Instead of writing your own parser, you can use existing libraries that handle front matter parsing.

#### **Python:**

- **[Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/)** with the `meta` extension:

  ```python
  import markdown

  with open('example.md', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
      text = f.read()

  md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=['meta'])
  html = md.convert(text)
  metadata = md.Meta  # Metadata is stored in md.Meta

  print("Metadata:", metadata)
  ```

- **[Frontmatter](https://github.com/eyeseast/python-frontmatter):**

  ```python
  import frontmatter

  post = frontmatter.load('example.md')

  print("Metadata:", post.metadata)
  print("Markdown Body:", post.content)
  ```

#### **JavaScript:**

- **[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter):**

  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');
  const matter = require('gray-matter');

  const content = fs.readFileSync('example.md', 'utf8');
  const parsed = matter(content);

  console.log('Metadata:', parsed.data);
  console.log('Markdown Body:', parsed.content);
  ```

- **[front-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter):**

  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');
  const frontMatter = require('front-matter');

  const content = fs.readFileSync('example.md', 'utf8');
  const parsed = frontMatter(content);

  console.log('Metadata:', parsed.attributes);
  console.log('Markdown Body:', parsed.body);
  ```

---

### **Best Practices**

- **Error Handling:**

  - Always include error handling to manage missing or malformed front matter.
  - Use safe parsing methods like `safe_load` in PyYAML to avoid executing arbitrary code.

- **Consistency:**

  - Ensure that all Markdown files follow the same front matter format.
  - Decide on a delimiter (`---` for YAML) and stick to it across all files.

- **Encoding:**

  - Be mindful of file encoding (usually UTF-8) when reading files to avoid encoding issues.

---

### **Alternative: Parsing Without Code**

If you prefer not to write code, you can use tools or online services to parse YAML front matter:

- **[YAML Front Matter Parser Online](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_yaml_parser.htm):**

  - Paste your Markdown content into the parser to extract and view the YAML front matter.

- **Text Editors with Plugins:**

  - **Visual Studio Code** with extensions like **Front Matter** can help manage and parse front matter.

---

### **Conclusion**

Parsing YAML front matter from a Markdown file involves:

- **Reading** the file content.
- **Extracting** the YAML front matter using string manipulation or regular expressions.
- **Parsing** the YAML into a usable data structure.
- **Accessing** the remaining Markdown content.

By utilizing available libraries or writing custom parsers in your preferred programming language, you can efficiently extract metadata from Markdown files for further processing.
